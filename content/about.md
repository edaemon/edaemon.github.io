I'm a sysadmin/DevOps/site reliability person living and working in Portland, Oregon. Originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, I moved to Portland to attend
[Lewis & Clark College](https://www.lclark.edu/) where I studied International Affairs and Computer Science. During my studies I worked as a research
assistant on computer security and how to educate students on security concepts. After graduating I became a system administrator at Tektronix, a
test and measurement company in Beaverton, supporting various web applications. As time went on I moved into a DevOps role where I debug complex problems,
automate CI pipelines, and get up in the middle of the night to fix production problems.
